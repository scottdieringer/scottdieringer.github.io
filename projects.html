            Given a bare bones implementation of a database, implement concurrency management using 
             six types of locks. There were three different tables indicating whether the locks were
            compatible, substitutable, or whether one lock could be a parent lock of another. 
            My implementation had to manage the acquiring, releasing, and waiting for locks held on
            databases, tables, and rows in the tables by different transactions running concurrently.
            Written in Java.

            Given a car that can hold a group of people and a list of locations, some of which are homes,
            find a route that starts and stops from a particular location and manages to get people to their
            house. You can either drop them off at their house or drop them off at a nearby location and have
            them walk home. When the person you are trying to get home is in the car the energy used is 2/3 
            units of energy and when they walk they use 1 unit of energy. Find the route that minimizes the 
            amount of energy used. The solution used the Christofides algorithm to find a route assuming the 
            homes were drop off locations and then eliminating paths that repeated themselves in order to 
            increase efficiency. Written in Python using the NetworkX graph library.

            Given a 2D grid, a starting point, a threshold and a certain number of iterations, find out 
            whether each point in the grid exceeds the threshold before a given number of iterations is 
            reached and then use that information to color a map which can be used to create a fractal, 
            i.e. an image that is the same when looked at closely as when it is looked at zoomed out. 
            The set was created using cellular automata and written in C.

            Given a list of 2D points and another 2D point not in the list, find the point in the list which is
            closest to the given point in logarithmic time. The solution organized the points into a k2 
            structure and used several mutually recursive functions to find the closest point. Written in Java.
